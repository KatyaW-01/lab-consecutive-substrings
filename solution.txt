Pseudocode:

create an empty array called results
for each index i in the string
for each following index j in the string
  pull out the substring from index i to j 
  add that substring to the results array

return the results array

Explanation of solution for string 'abc':

outer loop(i)
i = 0   a
i = 1   b
i = 2   c

inner loop
j = 1 string.slice(0,1) -> 'a'
j = 2 string.slice(0,2) -> 'ab'
j = 3 string.slice(0,3) -> 'abc'

next iteration
j = 2 string.slice(1,2) -> 'b'
...

this continues on until you have all of your consecutive substrings.

Time complexity: O(n^2) because of the nested loop
